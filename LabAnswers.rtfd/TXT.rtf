2. The error message. This message means that you are trying to access a property in your program that is not defined in the data. It could mean that you have not defined the variable in the correct scope. There is also the possibility that you are telling the program to use data that it not yet defined but will be later on. The way to fix this kind of error is to check all of your spelling and formatting first, then look for the variable that it is telling you is not defined and check the scope of the variable, to make sure that it is being defined properly. I am not 100% sure if this is correct, but that is what I believe the error means, sorry if I used the wrong words for some of the things, I am still trying my best to get a grasp on all of the terminology. \
